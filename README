This is "Fabother World": an Another World (Out Of This World in North America) interpreter codebase. This work is based on:

- Piotr Padkowski's newRaw interpreter which was based on
- Gregory Montoir's reverse engineering of
- Eric Chahi's assembly code.

I cleaned up a lot of the code, removing cryptic hexadecimal notation
with meaningful macros name. I also cleanup a lot of the code so it has a 
C/C++ philosophy instead of an assembly structure.

I also created a Visual Studio 2010 project.

TODO:

Create a MacOS X project.
Add a different rendering path OpenGL support.

raw is a re-implementation of the engine used in the game Another World. This

Please be aware that, currently, this implementation may contains bugs and 
non-implemented features that make it impossible to finish the game.
